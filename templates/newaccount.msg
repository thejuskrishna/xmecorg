Hi %name%

<http://www.xmec.org>
is the official site for the alumni of Model Engineering College,
Kochi. The most important function of the site is to serve as a means of
connecting all the MECians who have passed out of
Model Engineering College.

There are many who would like to have information pertaining to the kind
of work one is doing so that he/she can pose his specific queries to him.

There are often lots of mails asking for the xMECian presence in any
particular city or geography.

There are those who would like to contact someone from a particular
company regarding appointments, recruitments, projects etc.

We can achieve this if each one of us take time and show patience in
updating their profiles with accurate information especially area of work
(not designation), Company (or University) and current address. Please
take care in updating your profile with accurate information regularly.
Please do inform all other XMECians about the site so that we can
connect all XMECians in the earliest possible time.Your College Roll no
